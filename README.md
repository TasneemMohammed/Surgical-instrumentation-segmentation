# Surgical-instrumentation-segmentation

#### Intro to the challenge

The Surgical Instrumentation Segmentation and Action Recognition on Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Challenge includes 3 different sub-challenges.

1- Action recognition

2- Surgical instrument segmentation

3- Joint estimation of Action recognition and surgical instrument segmentation

#### Background information: 
This repo focuses on surgical tool segmentation, which is crucial in various computer-assisted intervention applications. This task involves processing RGB video frames and assigning semantic labels at the pixel level.

#### Goal: 
Our objective in this repo is to solve the semantic segmentation task and generate masks of prominent objects, including surgical tool parts, as well as thin and small tools such as surgical clips, suturing threads, and needles.
